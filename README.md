## About Me:
I am a graduate of the Red River College Polytechnic's Business Information Technology program. I have experience with programming and web development using languages such as Python, C#, Java, Go and TypeScript. I have a passion for all kinds of technology and enjoy learning about new tech whenever I have the chance. In my free time I like to work on my home lab, play video games, and work on my personal programming projects. If you want to connect feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn, Github, or via the contact form on my website.

## Tech I Use:
- Languages: Python, Typescript, C#, Java, and Go
- Web Development: React, Express.JS, Next.JS, and TailwindCSS
- Databases: PostgreSQL, MS SQL, and DynamoDB
- Deployment and CI/CD: Docker, AWS, Azure, and Github Actions

## Projects I am working on Right Now:
- [Simply Syslog](https://github.com/ryansteffan/simply_syslog): A dead simple to use syslog server that can be deployed via a docker container.
- [Whistler](https://github.com/RyanSteffan/Whistler): Discord has a lot of music bots, but not all of them are simple. Whistler is a discord bot that aims to change that by making it super simple to use, and deploy.
- [AWSCraft](https://github.com/RyanSteffan/AWSCraft): A close to one click solution for getting minecraft up and running in AWS using only the resources you need, keeping it cheep and affordable. Works with any Minecraft server.
